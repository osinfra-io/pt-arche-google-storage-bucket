## Repository Description

Reusable OpenTofu child module that creates a Google Cloud Storage bucket with uniform bucket-level access enforced, public access prevention, and optional object versioning. It supports customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) and a configurable storage class (STANDARD, NEARLINE, COLDLINE, ARCHIVE, etc.).

## 🔩 Usage

For CMEK, grant the Cloud Storage service agent access to `default_kms_key_name`. Setting `force_destroy = true` permits deletion of all objects with the bucket; use it only when that data loss is intentional.

> [!TIP]
> You can check the [tests/fixtures](tests/fixtures) directory for example configurations. These fixtures set up the system for testing by providing all the necessary initial code, thus creating good examples on which to base your configurations.

Google project services must be enabled before using this module. As a best practice, these should be defined in the [pt-arche-google-project](https://github.com/osinfra-io/pt-arche-google-project) module. The following services are required:

- `storage.googleapis.com`

## 🔍 Tests

All tests are [mocked](https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/commands/test/#the-mock_provider-blocks) allowing us to test the module without creating infrastructure or requiring credentials. The trade-offs are acceptable in favor of speed and simplicity. In an OpenTofu test, a mocked provider or resource will generate fake data for all computed attributes that would normally be provided by the underlying provider APIs.

## 📦 Release

To release a new version, simply push a new tag to the repository. The tag should be in the format `vX.Y.Z` where `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are integers.

```none
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```
